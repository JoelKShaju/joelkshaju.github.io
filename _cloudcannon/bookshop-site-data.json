On one hand, entrepreneurs created tech firms that employed thousands of employees worldwide. On the other hand, smaller firms that emerged as ancillary support or as secondary and tertiary consumers of these services, generated massive employment in both organized and unorganized sector. India&rsquo;s transition from an agriculture-based economy to a services-based economy was well in motion when I was born. But all of this had a deep personal relevance. My father, an IT engineer from a not very well-known college, struggled with jobs for most of his early career, working with multiple small and medium sized firms. I believe the only reason he could remain employed and feed his family was his background in IT. He has worked incredibly hard to provide a decent life to his family and the best possible education to his children. My motivation to pursue a graduate degree in &nbsp;computer science and a career in this field therefore is a part of a personal experiences-driven ambition &ndash; to contribute my bit to the upcoming computer science industry. I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science from the University of San Francisco.</p>"}],"slug":"about","ext":".html","tags":[],"excerpt":"","date":"2021-12-08 17:48:30 +0000","content":"","url":"/about/","relative_path":"_pages/about.html","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"default","title":"Certifications","content_blocks":[{"_bookshop_name":"page-heading","title":"Certifications","description":"Having a profound interest in developing solutions to real world problems and using Machine Learning in every possible manner, these courses helped me set my base strong.
